# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

House price is predicted in a city based on the different features such as area, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms. A Machine Learning model is used to predict the accurate house price.

## Overview

We will build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

 - Python
 - Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
 - Matplotlib for data visualization
 - Sklearn for model building
 - Google Colab
